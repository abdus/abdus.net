#### Seppuku

A Japanese ritual performed by high command when they loose a battle
where there were most likely to win. The person who is supposed to perform this
ritual, would kill himself with a dagger by cutting a part of abdomen
horizentally so that some of the organ comes out of his belly. This is also
known as __Harakiri__(belly cutting).

Initially this was reserved for Samurai, but adopted by other people when time
passed on.

The reason behind doing this ritual is, to __restore honor__.
