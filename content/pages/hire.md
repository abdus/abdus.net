I am available for work Feel free to send me a mail at
[abdus@abdus.net](mailto:abdus@abdus.net). You can find an online copy of my
resume at ~~[public.abdus.net](https://public.abdus.net/resume__abdus.pdf)~~.

Relevant Information:

- **Work Experience:** 2 Months(as an Intern). Fresher.
- **Overall Coding Experience:** I have been writing code since 2017. I used to code
  even before 2017, but that was not really full-time.
- **Projects:** Everything on [GitHub](https://github.com/abdus)
- **LinkedIn:** [here](https://linkedin.com/in/thisisabdus)

Technologies I use:

- FrontEnd
  - [JavaScript](https://github.com/search?l=JavaScript&o=desc&q=user%3Aabdus&s=updated&type=Repositories) -
    This is my primary computer language. I use it everyday.
  - [React](https://abdus.com/projects/#react) - UI framework I like to use.
  - [CSS](https://github.com/search?l=CSS&o=desc&q=user%3Aabdus&s=updated&type=Repositories) -
    I am good at it.
  - [HTML](https://github.com/search?l=HTML&o=desc&q=user%3Aabdus&s=updated&type=Repositories) -
    A bit better than CSS.
  - [Pug.js](https://pugjs.org/) - JavaScript template
    engine I prefer to use.
  - [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) - Another JavaScript template engine
  - [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) - A FrontEnd developer is incomplete
    without this awesome library.
- BackEnd
  - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) - Server-Side runtime for JavaScript, and
    something I heavily rely upon.
  - [Express](https://expressjs.com) - Preferred backEnd framework
  - [Passport](https://passportjs.org) - Auth Library
  - [SQL](#) - Language that database speaks
- Database
  - [MongoDB](https://mongodb.org) - NoSQL Database
  - [PostgreSQL](https://postgresql.com) - I am still learning.
- Others
  - [Git](https://git-scm.org) - Version Control. I have worked with SVN
    previously
  - [GNU](https://www.gnu.org/)/[Linux](https://www.linux.org/) - Don't ask me
    to work on Windows or Mac, please. I can consider \*BSD for some time :)
