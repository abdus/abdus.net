what to write about myself. But I will give it a try anyways.

So, I am Abdus. I am a developer living in
north-eastern part of India.

I am skilled at building websites, managing servers, playing with cloud stuffs
and of course Linux. For a list of technical skills I've got, please [visit this

Apart from programming, I do...well, nothing. Sometime, I play PC games.
