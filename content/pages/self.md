Hey there, I am Abdus. I am a full-stack developer.

Don't really know what to write about myself. I will try to write something
anyways.

I learnt most of the things I know on my own. I don't have a degree in Computer
Science, but I do have one in Computer Applications.

[ _Desperately trying to fill this page up with random things :/_ ]

I am a Linux geek. I have been using [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org) since
almost 2 years++. Here, I have my [dotfiles](https://github.com/abdus/dotfiles)

And if you are a developer, here's my [GitHub
Profile](https://github.com/abdus).
