## Intro

Hey there! You are welcome to the most weird area of my website. I have no idea
what to write about myself. But I will give it a try anyways.

So, I am Abdus. I am a developer living in
north-eastern part of India.

I am skilled at building websites, managing servers, playing with cloud stuffs
and of course Linux. For a list of technical skills I've got, please [visit this
page](/hire/).

Apart from programming, I do...well, nothing. Sometime, I play PC games.

## Contact Info

I am always reachable via Email abdus[at]abdus[dot]net.
If you are in LinkedIn, feel free to [connect](https://linkedin.com/in/thisisabdus).
Also, you can send me encrypted messages using my [GPG key](/keys/).

That's all about me! I will keep this page updated incase any exciting things
happens in my life(hopefully).
