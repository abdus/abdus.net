      I have known Abdus for about 2 years now as he has helped me manage a
      community of 80,000 programmers and engineers. I can always rely on Abdus
      to be professional, but more importantly his work ethic and always being
      available to help out with the community is what sets him apart. If you
      have an opportunity to work with Abdus, you are among the lucky ones. One
      of the most reliable people I know.

      Abdus is a highly skilled professional in his field. I've seen him code
      continuously for 8+ hours to create a website for our firm. I've seen him
      make a website serverless in under 10 mins, and it was legit crazy as I
      have never seen someone code so quick without any complications in the
      code. Abdus is a guy with in-depth knowledge of the technologies he works
      on. If you need someone fast and efficient with in-depth knowledge of web
      technologies, Abdus is your guy.

      Abdus is one of the most sincere young software engineer we have worked
      with. Besides being good at understanding the problem, he goes deep in to
      looking for the solution himself. I am sure with his hard work and grit,
      he is going to succeed always in his life.

      After taking out some time and thinking about the good things and values 
      Abdus adds to a table I came down to this side of his profile section:

      I like how you are very honest with what can be done and something that 
      will take more time and research, you give an exact timeline and make 
      sure to complete it.

      You're a driven co-worker, sometimes looking at your work makes me want
      to code too. (but I never do) 

      You like to read and research more which also helps us learn new things.

      Lastly, you're quite a gentleman, you take care of almost all of your
      co-workers like a family and especially make sure women around you feel
      confident and safe (important)

      More good lucks to you ðŸŒ·
